# Timenote- pwa

## What is this

This is a new version for the timenote application. It uses vanilla JS and bootstrap.

## What is Timenote : 

It is an application that enable you to take timestamps for any of your online classes. As an example, you can start out at the beginning of your class 
(or adjust if you are late), and whenever the teacher talks to a new topic or go to a different slide, you can add a new timestamp (the button with the
lines and the + symbol) and then add specific text related to what the teacher is talking about at that moment (it can be for example, the 
title of the slide)

Notes can be shared using a ShareSheet enabling them to save them wherever you want them to be, could be your faviorite note apps etc. 

## How can I contribute to this project 

- You can make add new features by making merge requests, I may or may not accept new features depending on whether they work correctly and whether they
match my vision of what timenote should be. If you have a different idea that would use this code you should fork this code instead. 

- You can financially support me (add link here). I mainly do these things for fun but I have expense related to my projects, such as web domains, 
developper registration fees (looking at you apple ...) and hardware material. Of course, I could introduce paid features, like new icons, but Quebec law
make this complicated as I would have to register as an entreprise to accept payments on the app store. Registering is not free, and since this is a niche product, 
I would have to make sure that my application makes money to cover the additionnal costs that is adding to the existing one. This is an additionnal stress
factor for me that I definitely do not need, and it would be time consuming as well. 

- You can help translating this project. There is not a lot of text in this app and I mostly use google translate to translate texts. If you want
 add new translations, feel free to make an issue ( I may use an other system if my project evolves accordingly, but it is not needed now, 
 keep reading what translations are needed and you will clearly understand why)
 
- If you have graphic talent and want to make better app store screenshot, a better logo, feel free to propose. Anything will probably be better than the current app pages.

## FAQ 

### When I use the save button on my phone it does not workl, what do?

Use of the PWA on non desktop, non chromium browser is no longer compatible, because I choosed to use a specific File Saver API that really does the thing I want. Chromium browsers are vastly popular and is the engine behind edge, which is the default browser. 

I do realize that we should not support google dominance over the web, but other browser engines do not implement these important features. 

### is this meant to be used in europe. 

No, if you live in a juridiction covered by GDPR,  you should not use this app, because of the use of google fonts. However this app is not geo fenced.
